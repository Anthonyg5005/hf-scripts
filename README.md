# scripts

Personal scripts to automate some tasks.\
Will try to keep external module use to a minimum, other than **huggingface_hub**.\
Feel free to send in pull requests or use this code however you'd like.

**For Github**: Would recommend creating pull requests and discussions on the [offical huggingface repo](https://huggingface.co/Anthonyg5005/hf-scripts)

## existing scripts

- Manage branches (create/delete)

## work in progress/not tested ([unfinished](https://huggingface.co/Anthonyg5005/hf-scripts/tree/unfinished) branch)

- Manage branches (Updating to new hf_hub funcion)
- Push to hf hub
