install the CUDA toolkit

Nvidia Maxwell or higher
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64

Nvidia Kepler or higher
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64

Haven't done much testing but Visual Studio with desktop development for C++ might be required. I've gotten cl.exe errors on a previous install

make sure you setup the environment by using windows-setup.bat
after everything is done just download a model using download-model.bat
to quant, use convert-model-auto.bat. Enter the model's folder name, then the BPW for the model
